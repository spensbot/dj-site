      <h2>Equipment</h2>
      <h4>Sound</h4>
      <p>
        I rent sound equipment from a reputable, local company. This ensures
        that every show I do has the ideal sound setup. If you want to go
        bigger, that is always an option!
      </p>
      <h4>Lighting</h4>
      <p>
        I have one of the best light systems you will ever see from a personal
        DJ. The setup contains pars, derby lights, light bars, strobes, moving
        spotlights, and more. I even bring 4 edison bulb string lights that can
        be controlled with the rest of the setup. Or I can take control of
        string lights at the venue if possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, my lighting setup runs on a app I designed myself.{" "}
        <Link href="https://captivatesynth.com">Captivate</Link> allows me to
        synchronize every light to the music in a way rarely seen outside of a
        high-production show.
      </p>
      <h4>Redundancy</h4>
      <p>
        I recognize how imporant it is that things go perfectly on the big day,
        so I plan for redundancy at every reasonable point in the system. I run
        lighing and sound on separate laptops, but each laptop is capable of
        running both if need be. And I bring a dedicated backup phone that is
        pre-loaded with hand-selected songs.
